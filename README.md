Recreation of the game shown in a Mind Field video, [The Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0), in which Michael from VSauce discusses the differences between chimpazee and human brains. The game is shown in the first 2 minutes.

In short, you have to memorize the positions of all the numbers on the grid.

In this implementation, you can adjust the size of the grid, the amount of numbers, the memorization time constraint, and the number of rounds.
